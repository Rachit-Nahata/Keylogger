Keylogger Project
Overview
This Python keylogger script is a basic example to capture keystrokes and save them to a file. It uses the pynput library to monitor keyboard events. Remember, this code is for educational purposes only. Always get explicit consent before using keyloggers in any real environment.

Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have Python installed and the pynput library. You can install it using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install pynput
Usage
Save the Script: Save the provided code to a file named keylogger.py.

Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run:

sh
Copy code
python keylogger.py
This will start the keylogger and it will begin logging keystrokes to keylog.txt.

Stop the Keylogger: To stop the keylogger, press the Esc key. This will stop the script and close the logging session.

Code Description
Logging: The script uses Python's logging module to write keystrokes to a file named keylog.txt. Each keystroke is recorded with a timestamp.

Key Handling:

on_press(): Logs each key press. Special keys are also logged by their name.
on_release(): Stops the logger when the Esc key is pressed.
Listener: A keyboard.Listener is used to listen to keyboard events.

Ethical Considerations
Use Responsibly: This script should only be used for educational purposes or in environments where you have explicit permission to do so. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

Legal Compliance: Ensure you comply with local laws and regulations regarding monitoring software.

Troubleshooting
Installation Issues: If you encounter problems installing pynput, ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and try upgrading pip.

Script Errors: If the script doesn't work as expected, check the file path and ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to write to keylog.txt.
